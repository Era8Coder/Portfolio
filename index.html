                <h3>Discrete Time Markov Chain(DTMC) using Hidden Markov Models</h3>
                <p>We need to analyze specific types of distributions, focusing solely on Gaussian distributions, to predict whether the market is "Bullish" or "Bearish." For this, we employ the Baum-Welch Algorithm, which is a special case of the Expectation-Maximization Algorithm. The hidden states of the model are represented in a transition matrix, and the observations follow a Gaussian distribution. Our goal is to identify the local maxima where the probability of the observations is at its peak. Used Python Libraries NumPy, Pandas and Random.</p>

            <div class="project-card right">
                <h3>Constructed a Programming Language</h3>
                <p>Created a compiler to translate the simple programming language into a designated executable target language. Designed a basic programming language featuring variable assignment, deletion, and arithmetic operations. Implemented data structures to handle unlimited integers/fractions and utilized AVL trees, binary search trees, and parse trees for evaluating expressions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-card left">
                <h3>Data Base Management System in Banks</h3>
                <p>Created a robust database management system utilizing Hashtable with an optimized data structure, enabling constant-time retrieval and insertion. Designed a custom hash function and implemented collision resolution techniques such as Linear Probing, Quadratic Probing, Cubic Probing, Open Addressing, and Chaining using vectors to enhance program efficiency and resilience.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-card right">
                <h3>Searching in Corpus (using C++)</h3>
                <p>Engineered a highly effective search engine capable of scanning text within a corpus akin to the PDF search function in Microsoft Edge or Adobe PDF reader. Employed the Rabin Karp Algorithm for word search efficiency and utilized a unique 4D vector storage method apart from standard 2D{Area} and 3D{Volume}, leveraging hash functions and hash tables for implementation.</p>

                <h3>MATLAB-based GUI Development, B.Tech Project</h3>
                <p>I worked on a MATLAB-based GUI development project as part of my B.Tech project from August 2025 to November 2025, where I designed and developed a graphical user interface integrated with the USRP B210 software-defined radio for RIS-aided wireless communication. The project involved implementing QPSK-based image transmission and addressing critical challenges such as high bit error rates (approximately 0.46) and synchronization issues. I also built a scalable framework with the objective of extending the system toward low-BER OFDM transmission and RIS-based beam steering techniques.</p>

                <h3>Software Engineering Intern – Microsoft, Hyderabad</h3>
                <p>
                   I developed a topology viewer for the Azure Networking team that enabled network engineers to visualize complex network topologies effectively. As part of this work, I designed and implemented a layer-wise view feature that displayed up to the third neighboring node from a selected node using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. I also integrated functionality to fetch and render network topologies from data stored as nodes and edges in a Kusto database, ensuring accurate and scalable visualization. In recognition of my contributions and impact, I earned a Pre-Placement Offer (PPO) from the Microsoft Azure Networking team.
